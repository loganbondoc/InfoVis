                    Fitness and health are an integral part of any balanced lifestyle. But
                    you know those people, the gym bros, the fitness freaks. <b><em>"How many calories are in this?"</em>
                        <em>"I need to hit my protein intake."</em></b> To outward appearance it may seem like overwhelming passion
                    for nutritious living, but whatâ€™s really going on under the surface?
                </p>

                    Fitness influencers are powerhouses on social media platforms, with hashtags such as <b>#fitness</b> amassing <b>510 million</b>
                    followers and <b>#fitnessmotivation</b> having <b>135 million</b> followers on Instagram in 2024. Not only that, their endorsement for a
                    plethora of health and fitness products, contributes to a market that has exploded from <b>1.7 billion USD</b> in 2016 to a projected <b>24 billion</b> in 2024.
                    Their impact is undeniable, yet a critical question looms large:

            A recent examination into the content disseminated by fitness personalities reveals a troubling lack of credibility.
            The University of Glasgow conducted a study evaluating health food products endorsed by the top 9 health food blog influencers in 2018.
            Alarmingly, <b>8 out of 9 of these influencers failed</b> the assessment on a number of criteria, while <b>every single one</b> missed
            their calorie targets.

            In a study conducted by BMC Public Health, 100 of the top Instagram accounts using the hashtag #fitspiration
            were evaluated for the credibility of their workout information and advice provided through video content.
            The findings highlighted that a significant number of these accounts were not credible sources of fitness advice as
            their content had a <b>strong focus on appearance</b> and <b>objectification of the body</b>, as opposed to health and functionality
            which leads to a rise in <b>body image concern</b> and <b>eating disorders</b> (Prichard et al., 2008).

            Moreover, a correlation exists between the time spent on social media and self-image related behavior.
            In a study conducted by Souvik, users were asked to rank their feelings towards statements on a scale of 1-5.
            The findings convey that <b>the longer time individuals spend on these platforms</b>, there is a heightened need for
            <b>validation-seeking behavior</b> as users draw <b>self-deprecating comparisons</b> between themselves and the success of others.

            <span>
                <p>
                    Research by Dr B. Jiotsa points to two primary theories that explain how social media can negatively impact body image.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comparison theory suggests that individuals who frequently compare themselves to others
                    deemed more attractive or fit are prone to body dissatisfaction, a process <b>intensified by
                    social media exposure.</b> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Objectification theory highlights the impact of societal norms, where women
                    and girls are socialized to view their bodies from an external perspective, leading to <b>self-objectification
                        and body dissatisfaction</b>. Similar patterns are observed in men and boys, with media promoting ideals of leanness and muscularity.
                </p>

        </div>
    </section>
    

    <section class = "page-section">
        <p>
            This creates a vicious cycle where the <b>lack of credibility and qualifications</b> among fitness influencers
            leads to the spread of <b>inaccurate and misleading health advice</b>. The health food products they promote often <b>fail
            to deliver</b> the promised results, leaving people dissatisfied with their bodies. The oversaturation of such content
            adversely impacts users' mental wellbeing, fostering <b>validation-seeking behavior and body dysmorphia.</b> As a result,
            individuals are more inclined to purchase these ineffective products and continue consuming misleading content,
            perpetuating the <b>cycle of dissatisfaction and misinformation.</b>
