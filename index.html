            Fitness and health is a __ thing that is good but it consumes the lives of people___.
            You know those people, the gym bros, the gym rats, How many calories are in this?
            I need to hit my protein intake. But whatâ€™s really going on under the surface?

                Fitness influencers are powerhouses on social media platforms, with hashtags such as #fitness amassing ____
                followers and #fitnessmotivation amassing hundreds of millions of followers. Not only that, their endorsement for a
                plethora of health and fitness products, contributes to a market that has exploded from 1.7 billion USD in 2016 to a projected 24 billion in 2024
                Their impact is undeniable, yet a critical question looms large:

        <h1>Are these influencers trustworthy sources of health and fitness advice?</h1>

        <p>
            A recent examination into the content disseminated by fitness personalities reveals a troubling lack of credibility.
            The University of Glasgow conducted a study evaluating health food products endorsed by the top 9 health food blog influencers in 2018.
            Alarmingly, 8 out of 9 of these influencers failed the assessment on a number of criteria, while every single one missed
            their calorie targets.

            In a study conducted by BMC Public Health, 100 of the top Instagram accounts using the hashtag #fitspiration
            were evaluated for the credibility of their workout information and advice provided through video content.
            The findings highlighted that a significant number of these accounts were not credible sources of fitness advice as
            their content had a strong focus on appearance and objectification of the body, as opposed to health and functionality
            which leads to a rise in body image concern and eating disorders (Prichard et al., 2008).

            Moreover, a correlation exists between the time spent on social media and self-image related behavior.
            In a study conducted by Souvik, users were asked to rank their feelings towards statements on a scale of 1-5.
            The findings convey that the longer time individuals spend on these platforms, there is a heightened need for
            validation-seeking behavior and as users draw self-deprecating comparisons between themselves and the success of others.
        </p>
        <div id="self-img"></div>

    <section class = "page-section">
        <p>
            This creates a vicious cycle where the lack of credibility and qualifications among fitness influencers
            leads to the spread of inaccurate and misleading health advice. The health food products they promote often fail
            to deliver the promised results, leaving people dissatisfied with their bodies. The oversaturation of such content
            adversely impacts users' mental wellbeing, fostering validation-seeking behavior and body dysmorphia. As a result,
            individuals are more inclined to purchase these ineffective products and continue consuming misleading content,
            perpetuating the cycle of dissatisfaction and misinformation.
